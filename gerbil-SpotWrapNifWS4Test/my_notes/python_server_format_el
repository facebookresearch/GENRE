David Jones MILAN 1996-08-30 Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market. Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd, which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, Shanghai. The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production, with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years. The move marks a further move by Pirelli\\u0027s cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia, India and Malaysia. \\"This is really positive news for Pirelli, and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies,\\" said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez. She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture, and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets. Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected. The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market. This will be Pirelli\\u0027s first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000, doubling demand for optical cables. China\\u0027s second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000, which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks. \\"The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value, representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia,\\" said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera. Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion, and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S., Europe and the Far East.

He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday, hoping in vain to find survivors. The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday, just east of Longyear. \\"Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board. Think of all that mixed together, with twisted, wrecked parts on the slope,\\" Onarheim, 29, told Reuters. Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site, protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses. The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians, coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden. Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people, but it also feels the loss keenly. \\"I have trouble finding the words to express my grief. It\\u0027s a tragedy for everyone.

Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet. Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total, it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months.

ARLINGTON, Texas 1996-08-31 Juan Gonzalez homered twice and Ivan Rodriguez added a two-run shot as the Texas Rangers defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3 in a matchup of division leaders Friday. Rodriguez\\u0027s 18th homer, off Chad Ogea (7-5) in the first, gave Texas a 2-0 lead. One out later, Gonzalez smacked his 40th homer, extending his hitting streak to 20 games. Gonzalez, who hit in 21 straight games earlier this season, joined Mickey Rivers as the only players in Texas history with two 20-game streaks in the same year. Gonzalez hit his second homer in the third for his fifth multi-homer game of the season. Gonzalez has three 40-homer seasons and his 121 RBI broke Ruben Sierra\\u0027s team record of 119 set in 1989. The Indians had their four-game winning streak stopped. \\"It\\u0027s not something I\\u0027m going to try to explain,\\" said Texas manager Johnny Oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from Cleveland this season. \\"We\\u0027ve got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season.\\" Roger Pavlik (15-7) gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings and became the fourth 15-game winner in the American League. Jeff Russell pitched two perfect innings for his third save. Brian Giles and Jim Thome homered for Cleveland. Cleveland\\u0027s lead over the White Sox in the American League Central dropped to nine games. Texas\\u0027s lead over Seattle in the West increased to six. At California, Tino Martinez\\u0027s two-run homer keyed a three-run first and Andy Pettitte became the league\\u0027s first 19-game winner as the New York Yankees beat the Angels 6-2. New York snapped a season-high five-game losing streak and also got homers from Mariano Duncan, Darryl Strawberry and Jim Leyritz. Pettite (19-7) allowed two runs and eight hits over eight innings with a walk and seven strikeouts. He improved to 12-2 following Yankees \\u0027 losses. Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth, striking out two. Ex-Yankee Randy Velarde hit his 11th homer, his most at any professional level. In Seattle, Pete Incaviglia\\u0027s grand slam with one out in the sixth snapped a tie and lifted the Baltimore Orioles past the Seattle Mariners, 5-2. It was Incaviglia\\u0027s sixth grand slam and 200th homer of his career. Baltimore\\u0027s Eddie Murray cracked his 20th homer of the season and 499th of his career. Jay Buhner hit his 38th homer and Edgar Martinez his 23rd for Seattle. The Orioles remained tied with the White Sox for the American League wild card with the Mariners a game back. In Toronto, Kevin Tapani (12-8) allowed two runs and six hits over 7 1/3 innings and Frank Thomas hit his 29th homer and drove in three runs as the Chicago White Sox cruised to an 11-2 victory over the Blue Jays. Thomas, Harold Baines and Robin Ventura each collected three hits. Baines homered and scored three runs. Danny Tartabull added two hits and three RBI as all Chicago starters got at least one hit. In Oakland, Dave Telgheder scattered seven hits over eight innings and Mark McGwire hit his major-league leading 45th homer and drove in three runs as the Athetlics blanked the Boston Red Sox 7-0. Telgheder (2-5) snapped a personal three-game losing streak. Buddy Groom pitched a perfect ninth inning. McGwire singled home a run to spark a three-run sixth and capped the scoring with a two-run homer in the seventh. The loss was Boston\\u0027s seventh in its last 29 games. In Detroit, Todd Van Poppel pitched a five-hitter for his first career shutout and Tony Clark homered to cap a four-run first inning as the Tigers blanked the Kansas City Royals 4-0. Van Poppel (3-6) walked two and struck out two in defeating the Royals for the second time this week. He threw 108 pitches as he lowered his ERA from 8.08 to 7.24. Kansas City has scored only one run in two games. In Milwaukee, Marc Newfield homered off Jose Parra (5-4) leading off the bottom of the 12th as the Brewers rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins. Milwaukee has won 10 of its last 15. Bob Wickman (6-1) pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win, his second for the Brewers. Matt Lawton hit a three-run homer off closer Mike Fetters with one out in the ninth to give Minnesota a 4-2 lead.

Andy Colquhoun JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday. They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand, salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests. It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil. Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side\\u0027s inspiration, scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes. Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other, scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties. The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points. But they generally endured an off-day, highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal. Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap. Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead, but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous. Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and, although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert\\u0027s reverse pass, Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts. Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback. Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks \\u0027 second try. A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter. When the All Blacks did break through, it was too late. Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens \\u0027 kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation.

text: RUGBY UNION - SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL. Andy Colquhoun JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday. They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand, salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests. It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil. Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side's inspiration, scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes. Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other, scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties. The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points.

MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin 1996-08-31 Jesper Parnevik of Sweden fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open. Parnevik, who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory, moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament. Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft. Nolan Henke, who led by two strokes entering the third round, carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195. He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic. Tiger Woods, who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional, shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament. The 20-year-old Woods, who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship, struggled on the front nine, bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four, 359-yard ninth hole. After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round, he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18. After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second, the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes. Parnevik continued to storm through the course, birdying three holes on the back nine, including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes. \\"I ca n\\u0027t remember when I\\u0027ve putted this well,\\" said Parnevik. \\"I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n\\u0027t go in.\\" My game feels very good. I\\u0027ve been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight. Whenever everyone\\u0027s making birdies, you never want to be even par. \\"Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes, including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole.\\" I did n\\u0027t hit it very well today, \\"said Henke.\\" Jasper blew right by me. Once he did, I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up. I made some really good pars. I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon. \\"Right now, I ca n\\u0027t put my finger on what\\u0027s wrong.\\" Bob Estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under. Steve Stricker, who tied for second at last week\\u0027s World Series of Golf, and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under. Duffy Waldorf, who also tied for second at the World Series of Golf, carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under, including Kraft. The top four on the PGA Tour money list all skipped the tournament."}'
