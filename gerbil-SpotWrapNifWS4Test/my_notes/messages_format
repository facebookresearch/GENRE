Request: AnnotatedDocumentImpl [uri=http://www.aksw.org/gerbil/NifWebService/request_117, text=NYMEX natgas ends sharply lower on weather outlook. NEW YORK 1996-12-06 NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures settled significantly lower Friday, pressured early by profit taking and driven even lower late by the National Weather Service's bearish six to 10 day forecast, sources said. January ended 29.7 cents lower at $ 3.487 per million British thermal units after dipping to a low of $ 3.46. Feb settled down 22 cents at $ 3.186. Most others also were down. "Weather forecasts have been sketchy. Now the National Weather Service is calling for above-normal temperatures in more than half of the U.S.," one futures trader said. In its forecast, the NWS said it expects above-normal temperatures "over the lower 48 states" from December 12 through December 16. With more room to the downside anticipated early next week, traders said support in January was at $ 3.47, then $ 3.35. The next backstops were seen at $ 3.11 and $ 3.04, the low set on November 21. Resistance was pegged at the new contract high of $ 3.80. In the cash market, Gulf Coast prices were around $ 3.60 shortly before nomination deadlines. Midcontinent prices were similarly lower in the $ 3.40s. New York city gate gas slipped into the $ 4.40s, down almost 15 cents. NYMEX said an estimated 35,662 Hub contracts traded, down from Thursday's revised tally of 43,955. NYMEX Alberta natgas remained untraded, with January settling at $ 1.65, off 10 cents from Thursday. Physical prices for the weekend at the AECO storage hub were also down about 10 cents in the C$ 1.92-1.97 per gigajoule, or $ 1.52-1.56 per mmBtu range, pressured by unseasonably mild weather in western Canada. NYMEX Permian natgas, also untraded, ended 10 cents lower at $ 2.90. In congruence with futures, Permian cash prices for the weekend fell more than 10 cents to the high - $ 3.40s. On the KCBT, January finished 26.5 cents lower at $ 3.35 after dipping to a low of $ 3.33 earlier in the session. February was down 22 cents at the close, while other deferreds were 4.5 to nine cents lower. The East / West spread narrowed by 3.2 cents to 13.7 cents (NYMEX premium). Physical prices at Waha for the weekend lost more than 15 cents to the low-to-mid $ 3.50s as milder weather moved into the Southwest.-- H McCulloch, New York Power Desk+212-859-1628, markings=[]]

CHICAGO 1996-12-06 As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans, a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year, more than half of which are suffered by children. "Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog," Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association. "Let's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them. Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction. Let's respect their territories," he said. Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children. He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed. Don Rieck, president of the National Animal Control Association, said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female. The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows, Rottweilers, German shepherds, cocker spaniels and Dalmatians. "The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique. Speaking strictly of dogs, 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman. Today, Rottweilers are on the way up," Rieck said. If approached by a stray dog, children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck, elbows in, and gaze forward until the dog goes away., markings=[]]>

CHICAGO 1996-12-06 As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans, a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year, more than half of which are suffered by children. "Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog," Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association. "Let's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them. Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction. Let's respect their territories," he said. Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children. He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed. Don Rieck, president of the National Animal Control Association, said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female. The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows, Rottweilers, German shepherds, cocker spaniels and Dalmatians. "The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique. Speaking strictly of dogs, 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman. Today, Rottweilers are on the way up," Rieck said. If approached by a stray dog, children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck, elbows in, and gaze forward until the dog goes away., markings=[(8, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Eukaryote, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Species, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mammal, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Animal]), (33, 8, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States], a [Schema:Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace, Schema:Country]), (47, 7, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago], a [Schema:Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/City, Schema:City, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace]), (87, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Eukaryote, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Species, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mammal, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Animal]), (117, 13, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States], a [Schema:Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace, Schema:Country]), (185, 12, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Veterinary_physician], a []), (240, 14, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent, Schema:Organization, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Non-ProfitOrganisation, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation]), (262, 13, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States], a [Schema:Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace, Schema:Country]), (479, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Eukaryote, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Species, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mammal, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Animal]), (509, 7, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glencoe,_Illinois], a [Schema:Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Village, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace]), (536, 14, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbus,_Ohio], a [Schema:Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/City, Schema:City, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace]), (583, 39, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Veterinary_Medical_Association], a []), (1116, 5, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog_breed], a []), (1133, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Eukaryote, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Species, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mammal, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Animal]), (1208, 8, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neutering], a []), (1279, 10, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chow_Chow], a []), (1291, 11, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rottweiler], a []), (1304, 16, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Shepherd], a []), (1322, 15, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cocker_Spaniel], a []), (1369, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Eukaryote, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Species, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mammal, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Animal]), (1530, 5, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machismo], a []), (1567, 11, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rottweiler], a []), (1636, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Eukaryote, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Species, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mammal, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Animal]), (1759, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog], a [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Eukaryote, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Species, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mammal, http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Animal])]]

Result: AnnotatedDocumentImpl [uri=http://www.aksw.org/gerbil/NifWebService/request_125, text=Four Africans said to vie for top U.N. post. Evelyn Leopold UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06 Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election. The nominees, according to diplomats, are : Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid Algabid of Niger, the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing, the envoys said. It was not known if other candidates would step forward. Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90, was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country. Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race. His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse. The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him. The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week, a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee. The Security Council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General Assembly before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali's term expires., markings=[(34, 4,

ROME 1996-12-06 Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of Italy's Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, said on Friday she had rejoined the far-right National Alliance (AN) party she quit over policy differences last month. "I've gone back," she told a radio show shortly after AN leader Gianfranco Fini, who was being interviewed on the programme, said the row had been resolved. "He did n't want to lose me and I did n't want to lose him." Fini told state radio RAI he met Mussolini thanks to the good offices of Giuseppe Tatarella, AN's leader in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), and had overcome their differences. Mussolini, 33, resigned from the parliamentary party group for what she said were strictly political reasons. The fiery politician, who is also a niece of screen star Sophia Loren, had accused AN leaders of stifling internal party debate.

In local currency terms, Italian BTPs offered returns of 0.85 percent in the week ended on Thursday, with fellow high-yielder Sweden close behind on 0.80 percent.

Canada's were the worst performing bonds. They lost 2.21 percent, depressed by a wave of new Canadian supply. Returns on Treasuries were also in negative territory at minus 0.24 percent, the poorest result after Canada and British gilts which lost 0.28 percent. Australia was the only dollar-bloc country in the table to eke out a positive return, albeit a paltry 0.02 percent. German Bunds were not much better, offering returns of 0.05 percent, while Japanese government bonds managed a 0.38 percent gain. Spanish bonds, which had been top performers in Salomon Brothers ' league table for November as a whole, turned in a more subdued weekly performance with a return of only 0.27 percent. In U.S. dollar terms, Japan was the only country to give positive returns at 1.35 percent. France lost 0.37 percent, followed by Italy on minus 0.59 percent. The biggest losers in dollar terms were British gilts, which shed 3.41 percent, Canada with minus 3.03 percent and Australia at minus 1.54 percent.

Result: AnnotatedDocumentImpl [uri=http://www.aksw.org/gerbil/NifWebService/request_136, text=Italy tops week of meagre bond returns - Salomon. LONDON 1996-12-06 High-flying Italy topped the league in a week of meagre returns on government bonds, Salomon Brothers said on Friday. In local currency terms, Italian BTPs offered returns of 0.85 percent in the week ended on Thursday, with fellow high-yielder Sweden close behind on 0.80 percent. The weekly government bond index rose 0.07 percent in local currency terms. France managed third place with 0.68 percent in the 16-nation world government bond index. Canada's were the worst performing bonds. They lost 2.21 percent, depressed by a wave of new Canadian supply. Returns on Treasuries were also in negative territory at minus 0.24 percent, the poorest result after Canada and British gilts which lost 0.28 percent. Australia was the only dollar-bloc country in the table to eke out a positive return, albeit a paltry 0.02 percent. German Bunds were not much better, offering returns of 0.05 percent, while Japanese government bonds managed a 0.38 percent gain. Spanish bonds, which had been top performers in Salomon Brothers ' league table for November as a whole, turned in a more subdued weekly performance with a return of only 0.27 percent. In U.S. dollar terms, Japan was the only country to give positive returns at 1.35 percent. France lost 0.37 percent, followed by Italy on minus 0.59 percent. The biggest losers in dollar terms were British gilts, which shed 3.41 percent, Canada with minus 3.03 percent and Australia at minus 1.54 percent.

Palestinian Authority Secretary General Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said on Thursday he understood it could be held in Cairo either on Friday or Sunday. Abdel-Rahman had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish sabbath. But the Jewish sabbath ends at sundown, so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance., markings=[(0, 3, [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palestine_Liberation_Organization], a
