The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle. Vicenza (1) v Internazionale (2) 1330 Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless.

The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in KwaZulu-Natal and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots. They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers, some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores, flock back to their home villages.

DURBAN, South Africa 1996-12-06 At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in South Africa's volatile Zulu heartland, police said on Friday. A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of Izingolweni on KwaZulu-Natal province's south coast on Thursday night. The victims were 18 and 20, he said, adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting. In another attack, also on the province's south coast on Thursday night, two men were shot dead near Umkomaas. "We suspect that these killings are linked to politics," spokesman Bala Naidoo told Reuters. There had been no arrests. The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in KwaZulu-Natal and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots. They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers, some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores, flock back to their home villages. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the ANC and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party in the province.

Van Boxmeer said Poland\\u0027s top five brewers, which produce about 55 percent of the country\\u0027s beer, could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors. Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim. Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd (SAB) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers, which together hold more than 20 percent of the market, and Australia\\u0027s Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland\\u0027s larges t brewery, Elbrewery Company Ltd. (EB). Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation, which had added to the pressure on the firm\\u0027s margins. He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share. But he said the company\\u0027s investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade, largely in production, would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic. Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998, but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market\\u0027s overcapacity. \\"I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers-- and I\\u0027m speaking about all the brands-- and as we make good beers... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers,\\" he said. Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim, which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year, but that Zywiec\\u0027s potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one. He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand, Zywiec Full Light, which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country\\u0027s largest-selling brand. \\"You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands,\\" van Boxmeer said, adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland.

Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont, announced Thursday. Wall Street, since the bid, has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a \\"bear hug,\\" or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor. Newmont said the companies have had previous contact, though declined to detail the encounters. Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder, and that if a rival buyer is found, Newmont may not be able to match its offer. They said the Santa Fe deal, which includes desirable Nevada mining territory, would only payoff for Newmont longer term. Newmont, in fact, will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years, which also limits its capacity to raise its offer. Any deal, friendly or hostile, would almost assuredly be a stock swap, which is necessary to preserve the tax-free, pooling-of-interest accounting, they said. Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia\\u0027s Busang vast gold deposit. Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe\\u0027s Nevada, South America and Central Asia presence, they said.

Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada, California, Montana, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Chile, Kazakstan, Mexico and Ghana. PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe, investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion. \\"I think Homestake could come in as a white knight, but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number. One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent, but there is going to be a (Santa Fe) deal with someone,\\" he said. \\"Longer term, two to three years out, (a Newmont-Santa Fe deal) is positive, it does all the right things. But in the near-term it is, at worst, neutral,\\" the analyst added. Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares. In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade, Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8. \\"Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe, which is almost always a euphemism for \\u0027 We have more money in our pocket, \\u0027\\" said an arb, referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont.
