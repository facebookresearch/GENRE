Gerbil
========
<i>General Entity Annotator Benchmark</i>

This branch is part of the Gerbil project. It contains a very simple Webservice that wraps the DBpedia Spotlight Webservice and implements the NIF communication. We use it to test the NIF based Webservice annotator adapter that is part of Gerbil.
